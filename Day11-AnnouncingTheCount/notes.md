# Notes file for Day 11: Announcing the Count

This one was quite a trip. At first I did what probably everyone else did and simply added `aria-live="polite"`. This did not work *at all* in Firefox using Windows Narrator. In Edge it only worked correctly if I also added `role="status"`. It was a mess so I did some research.

I found an article from LÃ©onie that makes a strong case for using both `aria-live="polite"` and `role="status"`: [Screen reader support for ARIA live regions](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/03/screen-reader-support-aria-live-regions/).

Then I realised that tags within the live-region were preventing the content from being read out fully. So I tried removing the inner tags. Bingo! NVDA and Windows Narrator started reading the full content. So I set about refactoring my code to build the whole count sentence, including tags.

A couple of notes on my code:

- Refactored from last time to make it simpler.
- Added a pluraliser for word or words (1 word, 2 words, etc). Makes the reading
  sound much better.
- Still using the `pageshow` event to handle refreshes on Firefox. This is where
  Firefox helpfully retains the content of a textarea on refresh. The count
  update triggers when the page reloads. This is much more user friendly than
  clearing the textarea on refresh.
- Refactored the regex into a const.
- Used `<b>` tags to bring attention to the numbers while not adding semantic
  strong emphasis.
